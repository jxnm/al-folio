I am a versatile, innovative collaborator who solves problems. I'm happiest working and learning at the intersection of journalism, technology and design.

For the last 18 months, I worked on an initiative at <a href="https://wbur.org">WBUR</a> called <a href="https://wbur.org/citrus">Project CITRUS</a>, funded by the Google News Initiative. Before that I worked for a radio show called <em>Here & Now</em>, a co-production of NPR and WBUR. I managed the show's digital content strategy and daily production.

Thank you for visiting my website.
