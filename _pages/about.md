I am a versatile, innovative collaborator who solves problems. I'm happiest contributing my skills at the intersection of journalism, technology and design. I'm a journalist by training, but I draw inspiration from a range of disciplines. A co-worker of mine once referred to me as a "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/five-tool_player#English">five-tool player</a>," using a baseball analogy. I thought that was pretty cool.

For the last 18 months, I've been working on an initiative at <a href="https://wbur.org">WBUR</a> called <a href="https://wbur.org/citrus">Project CITRUS</a>, funded by the <a href="https://twitter.com/rlubb">Google News Initiative</a>. Before that I worked for a radio show called <em>Here & Now</em>, a co-production of NPR and WBUR. I managed the show's digital content strategy and daily production.

Thank you for visiting my website. It's been fun building it and I hope to continually improve it in my spare time.
